## Echos After Dark

Echos After Dark is a progressive rock band from Nebraska.  Their core sound has been influenced by a wide array of artists and genres to create something rather unique.  Echos After Dark's sound was meticulously sculpted using elements of progressive rock, alternative, jazz, and choral music.

## History
An unnamed music group was formed in 2022 as a passion project with founding members: Brandon Watson, Chris Mauer, DJ Hardesty, and John Douglas.  The group entered the studio in August of 2022 to begin recording of their debut album, completing the project in July of 2024.

Shortly after completion of their debut album, the group gave themselves the name "Echos After Dark".  The word "[Echos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echos)" in this context is a play on words and not to be confused with the more commonly-spelled "[Echoes](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/echo)".

## Influences
Echos After Dark takes inspiration for a rather extensive list of artists.  Some of the more promenent influences for their work include (but are not limited to):
- Avenged Sevenfold
- Cake
- Dream Theater
- Haken
- Mike Jones
- Red Hot Chili Peppers
- Rush
- System of a Down
- Tenacious D
